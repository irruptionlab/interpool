                        The first prediction game is now live for the FIFA WORLD CUP - Group stage. Competition starting date: November 20th 2022.</p>

More tickets you get, higher will be your winnings. <br />In order to get tickets, you need to deposit a multiple of the unitary price (50 USDC). You can faucet USDC directly on the InterPool app. <br />All the participant deposits will be locked during the game period in order to generate interests. <br />Those interests represent the overall prize pool that the game participants will share.</p>

                        <em>Note 1: your predictions must be saved during the prediction period (there is a countdown shown above). As the first prediction game is live for the FIFA WORLD CUP - Group phase, your prediction must be saved prior the starting date: November 20th 2022.<br />‍<br />Note 2: As long as the prediction period is not over, you can submit new predictions. The last submission you have done will be the only one considered, and the previous ones will therefore be overridden.</em><br /></p><div id="w-node-_20dbb91a-a1bb-22b9-5a25-a427b6707be8-3d3dc5f0">⚽</div><p id="w-node-dcd78d48-0867-a502-6033-7e5938725a3b-3d3dc5f0"><strong>At the end of the contest, the prize pool is shared based on the final rankings of all the participants. </strong>The details of the prize pool distribution is explained in (<a href="https://irruption-lab.gitbook.io/interpool/welcome/frequently-asked-questions#prizes-and-winning" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><div id="w-node-_1048304c-49a0-06cd-a9c4-555c570ffb31-3d3dc5f0">⚽</div><p id="w-node-_3f7c3c92-ee7e-12ec-0d5e-7c65038eeda3-3d3dc5f0"><strong>You can get your deposit back right after the end of the contest, or go on for another round, your ticket(s) make you eligible for all the future games! </strong>Fill in your predictions for the next contest and win more prizes! </p>
